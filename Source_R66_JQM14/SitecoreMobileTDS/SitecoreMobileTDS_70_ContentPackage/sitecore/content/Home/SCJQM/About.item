<p>The Sitecore jQuery Mobile component library is designed to give developers and content authors the ability to quickly create and manage mobile HTML5 websites that look great across a extremely wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, feature phones and desktops.&nbsp;The components can be easily combined or customized to&nbsp;create&nbsp;composite views and custom controls.&nbsp;</p><p>The components&nbsp;provide the foundation&nbsp;for creating sites with nothing but the Sitecore Page Editor. Authors will enjoy working with content in an immersive and representational WYSIWYG experience. </p><p>Sitecore Partners can deliver mobile websites that support 95% of all consumer mobile devices. Sitecore JQM has a huge amount of support for the different mobile devices due to its graded browser support, open source nature of testing and strict HTML5 semantic markup.</p><p>The HTML5&nbsp;markup&nbsp;can be integrated to create web apps,&nbsp;or used within native apps, such as IOS or Android apps, via native embedded web browsers.</p><p>The component library is a great project starting point and provides partners with best-practice HTML 5, CSS and JS for web-friendly mobile design.</p><p>The components are built on Sitecore MVC&nbsp;but Sitecore MVC experience is not required to start building mobile sites. Customized HTML5 rendering components can be created quickly in Sitecore MVC and easily&nbsp;added on top of the base library. </p><p>This project builds upon the standard jQuery Mobile framework and includes the Sitecore renderings components necessary to render the HTML5 markup on the server. Sitecore standard content management practices are in full swing and makes heavy use of the Sitecore MVC framework. A unreleased build of the framework for WebForms is available on request.</p><p>Partners are able to quickly implement best-practice mobile-friendly websites</p><p>The idea is to create entire mobile sites and pages from scratch using only the Sitecore Page Editor. Content components like Buttons and&nbsp;Headings are&nbsp;inserted&nbsp;into a standardized layout and placeholder structure. Complex page structures can be created using components that define new placeholders, in which content and more placeholders can be inserted. </p><p>This site will be the primary source of documentation and distribution during the introduction period. </p><p>This software is provided as is for use at your own risk.</p>
